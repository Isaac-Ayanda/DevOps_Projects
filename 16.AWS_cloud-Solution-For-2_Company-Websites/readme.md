# AWS Cloud Solution For Two Company Websites Using A Reserve Proxy Technology
In this project, I built a secure three-teir infrastructure solutin inside AWS VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) network for a fictitious company that uses WordPress CMS for its corperate website, and a [Tooling](https://github.com/Isaac-Ayanda/tooling) Website for their DevOps team - As part of the companyâ€™s desire for improved security and performance, a decision has been made to realize the infrastructure setup using NGINX reverse proxy technology. The infrastructure would need to be resilient and at optimized cost.

10. Create security groups for application loadbancer.

![create security group](./images/create-securitygroup1.jpg)
![create security group](./images/create-securitygroup2.jpg)
![create security group](./images/create-securitygroup3.jpg)

11. Create security group for bastion server.

![create security group](./images/create-sgbastion1.jpg)
![create security group](./images/create-sgbastion2.jpg)
![create security group](./images/create-sgbastion3.jpg)


12. Create security group for nginx reverse proxy server. Inbound rule should only allow traffic from the application loadbalancer (i.e. refering the security group of the application loadbalancer) and ensure that bastion server have ssh access to the reverse proxy server.

![create security group](./images/create-sgnginx1.jpg)
![create security group](./images/create-sgnginx2.jpg)
![create security group](./images/create-sgnginx3.jpg)

13. Create security group for the internal loadbalancer. Inbound rule allows traffic (http/https) only from nginx reverse proxy.

![create security group](./images/create-sginternallb1.jpg)
![create security group](./images/create-sginternallb2.jpg)
![create security group](./images/create-sginternallb3.jpg)

14. Create security group for the webserver such that its inbound rule should only allow SSH traffic from the Bastion and https/http traffic from the internal loadbalancer.

![create security group](./images/create-sgwebservers1.jpg)
![create security group](./images/create-sgwebservers2.jpg)
![create security group](./images/create-sgwebservers3.jpg)

15. Create security group for the data layer such that Mysql/Aurora access specified for bastion and webserver, and NFS access specified for webserver.

![create security group](./images/create-sgdatalayer1.jpg)
![create security group](./images/create-sgdatalayer2.jpg)
![create security group](./images/create-sgdatalayer3.jpg)

16. First register a domain name. This can be obtained from freenom and transfer its settings to AWS to ensure cost savings. Then go to AWS certificate manager to create the certificate to be attached to the application loadbalancer.

![create domain name](./images/create-certificate1.jpg)
![create certificate](./images/create-certificate2.jpg)
![create certificate](./images/create-certificate3.jpg)
![create certificate](./images/create-certificate4.jpg)
![create certificate](./images/create-certificate5.jpg)


17. Create Amazon Elastic file system. Add mount target (i.e. specify it in private subnets 1 and 2 and select the datalayer security group). Then create each access points for the tooling and wordpress sites on the AE file system. The webservers will have seperate mounts. This will avoid file overide.

![create RDS](./images/create-rds5.png)
![create RDS](./images/create-rds4.png)
![create RDS](./images/create-rds6.png)


Second Step: Setup Compute Resources
1. Before creating an autoscalling group there is need to first create a target group, launch template (Consist of AMIs and user data) and Loandbalancers. The autoscalling group will make use of launch templates and loadbalancers to spinup instances. Create AMIs by launching 3 t-2micro RedHat instances for nginx, bastion and webserver then install AMI dependencies starting with the bastion server.

![create 3 instances](./images/create-3instances.jpg)

- Connect and install ami dependencies on bastion server. 
    - Run `yum install -y https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-8.noarch.rpm`
    - `yum install -y dnf-utils http://rpms.remirepo.net/enterprise/remi-release-8.rpm`
    - `yum install wget vim python3 telnet htop git mysql net-tools chrony -y`
    - `systemctl start chronyd`
    - `systemctl enable chronyd`

2. Create Launch templates.
- Create launch template for bastion server. Network interface placed in public subnet, select bastion security group, auto assign IP: enabled then go to advance details section and add the bastion user data. 

![create launch template](./images/create-launch-temp1.jpg)


- Create launch template for nginx. Placed in public subnet and add the user data. 

![create nginx launch template](./images/create-nginx-launch-temp1.jpg)

- Create launch template for wordpress in a private subnet. Webserver security group. Disable public ip. Also update the mount point to the filesystem by copying the command without the efs and also update the rds end point in the 'wordpress user data.md file. Remember to login to the rds to create the database. Also ensure all other credentials are correct.

![create wordpress launch template](./images/create-wordpress-launch-temp2.jpg)
![create wordpress launch template](./images/create-wordpress-launch-temp5.jpg)

- Create launch template for tooling using the same AMI used for wordpress. It is created in a private subnet with webserver security group. Disable public ip. Then add the user-data under advanced but ensure the credentials are correct. Update the RDS endpoint for tooling in the user data file . Also update the mount point to the assess point filesystem by copying the command without the efs. Remember to login to the RDS to create the database.
